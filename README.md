# Rainfall-Prediction
A machine learning project to predict if it will rain tomorrow using weather data. This includes traditional ML models, a 1D CNN for classification, and fuzzy logic to interpret CNN confidence scores more intelligently.


🔧 Features

Weather data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding, scaling)
Machine Learning Models:
Linear Regression
Lasso Regression
Random Forest
Deep Learning using 1D CNN
Fuzzy logic applied on CNN output for confidence-based decision making
Accuracy comparison and result visualization


💻 Tech Used

Python
NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Plotly
scikit-learn
TensorFlow / Keras
Custom fuzzy logic


🚀 How to Use

Clone the repository or open in Jupyter/Colab.
Install required packages:
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib plotly scikit-learn tensorflow
Ensure the dataset file weatherAUS.csv is in the same directory.
Run the script or notebook to train and evaluate all models.


📌 Notes

The fuzzy logic layer is manually implemented to interpret CNN probabilities (Low, Medium, High confidence).
All models are trained on 80% of the data and tested on the remaining 20%.
Results may vary slightly based on system performance and random seed.
